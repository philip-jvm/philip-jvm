### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , welcome to my github!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for all things Java, Spring and GraphQL.

So far, I have been very fortunate to experience the bad, good, ugly and pretty. Ranging from legacy & gargantuan Java applications, monolith -> microservices, to greenfield internet-scale services processing billions of requests daily.

Since early 2018 I have mainly focused on building GraphQL servers backed by gRPC, REST, serverless functions and async messaging.

In my spare time I enjoy creating youtube videos and hopefully you enjoy them ðŸ˜„!

At the moment I'm currently learning more about strategy, lean, kubernetes and GCP.

ðŸ”­ Idea -> Build > Measure -> Learn

Have a good day!
