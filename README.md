### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , welcome to my github!

I'm a lifelong learner and craftsman with a passion for all things Java, Spring and GraphQL.

This led me to create and publish a free <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiwhu8iLxKwL1TU0RMM6z7TtkyW-3-5Wi">Learn GraphQL Spring Boot course</a>. I hope you enjoy it!ðŸ˜„

At the moment I'm currently learning more about strategy, lean, kubernetes and GCP.

ðŸ”­ Idea -> Build > Measure -> Learn

Current tech stack: Java11, GraphQL, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, gRPC, Maven, GitHub, Microservices, Kubernetes & Google Cloud Platform.

Have a good day!
