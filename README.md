### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , welcome to my github!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for all things Java, Spring and GraphQL.

So far, I have been very fortunate to experience the bizarre, excellent, ugly, pretty software systems. Ranging from unstable legacy & gargantuan Java applications, monolith -> microservices, to greenfield internet-scale services processing billions of requests daily with rock solid uptime.

Since early 2018 I have mainly focused on building GraphQL servers backed by gRPC, REST, serverless functions and async messaging.

This led me to create and publish a free <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiwhu8iLxKwL1TU0RMM6z7TtkyW-3-5Wi">Learn GraphQL Spring Boot course</a>. I hope you enjoy it!ðŸ˜„

At the moment I'm currently learning more about strategy, lean, kubernetes and GCP.

ðŸ”­ Idea -> Build > Measure -> Learn

Have a good day!
